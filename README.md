# linky

Linky is a simple webapp that works in conjunction with a bookmarklet to send links from any browser to a registered email address.

**Use this useful but poorly designed linky-thingy at [linkyto.me](https://linkyto.me).**

I built it for my own benefit to replace a web app of yore I've long missed, ccto.me.
